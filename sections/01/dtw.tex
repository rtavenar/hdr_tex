\section{Dynamic Time Warping}
\label{sec:dtw}

This section covers works related to Dynamic Time Warping for time series.

\subsection{Definition}


Dynamic Time Warping (DTW,~\cite{sakoe1978dynamic}) is a similarity measure
between time series.
Consider two time series $\mathbf{x}$ and
$\mathbf{x}^\prime$ of respective lengths $n$ and
$m$.
Here, all elements $x_i$ and $x^\prime_j$ are assumed to lie in the same
$p$-dimensional space and the exact timestamps at which observations occur are
disregarded: only their ordering matters.

\subsubsection{Optimization Problem}

In the following, a path $\pi$ of length $K$ is a
sequence of $K$ index pairs
$\left((i_0, j_0), \dots , (i_{K-1}, j_{K-1})\right)$.

DTW between $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{x}^\prime$ is formulated as the following
optimization problem:

\begin{equation}
DTW(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^\prime) =
    \min_{\pi \in \mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^\prime)}
        \sqrt{ \sum_{(i, j) \in \pi} d(x_i, x^\prime_j)^2 }
\label{eq:dtw}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^\prime)$ is the set of all admissible
paths, \emph{i.e.} the set of paths $\pi$ such that:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\pi$ is a sequence $[\pi_0, \dots , \pi_{K-1}]$ of index pairs
  $\pi_k = (i_k, j_k)$ with $0 \leq i_k < n$ and $0 \leq j_k < m$
\item $\pi_0 = (0, 0)$ and $\pi_{K-1} = (n - 1, m - 1)$
\item for all $k > 0$ , $\pi_k = (i_k, j_k)$ is related to
  $\pi_{k-1} = (i_{k-1}, j_{k-1})$ as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[$\ast$] $i_{k-1} \leq i_k \leq i_{k-1} + 1$
  \item[$\ast$] $j_{k-1} \leq j_k \leq j_{k-1} + 1$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Here, a path can be seen as a temporal alignment of time series and the optimal
path (as presented in Figure~\ref{fig:dtw}) is such that
Euclidean distance between aligned (\emph{ie.} resampled) time series is
minimal.

series, shown on top of the cross-similarity matrix that stores
$d(x_i, {x}^\prime_j)$
values. \label{fig:dtw}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Algorithmic Solution}

There exists an $O(mn)$ algorithm to compute the exact optimum for this
problem, assuming computation of $d(\cdot,\cdot)$ is $O(1)$
(see Algorithm~\ref{algo:dtw}).

\begin{algorithm}[t]
 \caption{DTW algorithm. For the sake of simplicity, out-of-bound accesses to $C$ are assumed to return $\infty$.}
 \label{algo:dtw}
 \KwData{$(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^\prime)$ : a pair of time series}
 \For{$i$ = 0..$n-1$}{
   \For{$j$ = 0..$m-1$}{
     dist = $d(x_i, x^\prime_j)^2$ \\
       \eIf{$i$ == 0 \textup{\textbf{and}} $j$ == 0}{
         $C_{i, j} =$ dist
       }{
         $C_{i, j} =$ dist $+ \min(C_{i-1, j}, C_{i, j-1}, C_{i-1, j-1})$
       }
    }
  }
  \Return $\sqrt{C_{n - 1, m - 1}}$
\end{algorithm}


\subsubsection{Properties}

Dynamic Time Warping holds the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\forall \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^\prime, DTW(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^\prime) \geq 0$
\item $\forall \mathbf{x}, DTW(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}) = 0$
\end{itemize}

However, mathematically speaking, DTW is not a valid metric since it
satisfies neither the triangular inequality nor the identity of indiscernibles.

\subsubsection{Setting additional constraints}

The set of temporal deformations to which DTW is invariant can be reduced by
imposing additional constraints on the set of acceptable paths.
Such constraints typically consist in forcing paths to stay close to the
diagonal.

The Sakoe-Chiba band is parametrized by a radius $r$ (number of
off-diagonal elements to consider, also called warping window size sometimes),
as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:sakoe}.
The Itakura parallelogram sets a maximum slope $s$ for alignment
paths, which leads to a parallelogram-shaped constraint (see Figure~\ref{fig:itakura}).
